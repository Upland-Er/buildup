      <h1>GSBF Rules</h1>
      <h2>3 Strike 1 day system</h2>
    <p>If you break one of the following rules you will lose 1 strike, if you lose all 3 strikes you will be banned from buildup the next day, if it is a Friday then you will be punished the following Monday</p>     
      <h2>No targetting</h2>
      <p>A tag or chase is designated targetting if when it begins the person tagged or being chased was further away from those who initiated the chase then another person.</p>
  <h2>If you are caught you must put effort into to your chases</h2>
  <p>This rule is rather self explanatory, if you are seen simply walking while you are caught you will be required to speak to the council.</p>
  <h2>Pausing is only permitted if you are injured</h2>
  <p>A stitch does not count as an injury, you are permitted to pause if you slipped, fell or tripped.</p>
